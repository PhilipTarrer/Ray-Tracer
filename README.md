# Ray-Tracer
# Philip Tarrer 

This project is a simple ray tracing image implementation with ambience, diffusion, reflection, color, and multiple light sources.

Running -> keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and - will run different complex polygons with unique colors, light sources, and relfection values 
in the ray tracing algorithm 

Built using Processing 3 in Python
